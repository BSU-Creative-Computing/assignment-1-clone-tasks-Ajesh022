<p>What the actual distinction between art and design is is a question that many people have when they want to start their own creative or design endeavor.
    Some insist they are two completely different things, while others say there isn't a difference at all. We will examine some of the fundamental distinctions between art and design in this piece and attempt to provide a definitive response to that crucial query.
    A plan or specification for the creation of an object, system, activity, or process is called a design.The goal of the design process is to produce a process, a plan, a prototype, or a product. The user is the primary focus of the design process at all times. The goal of design is to provide solutions for physical objects, systems, or people.</p>


<p>There are ways to tell the difference between art and design, even though it might not be obvious at first. All visual works can, in my opinion, be classified into one of these categories.
    This is their meaning. Art is a way to communicate feelings or ideas.This does not imply that it must be representational or abstract, even though those are popular styles of art.
    Design is a problem-solving tool. Therefore, even though design may also elicit emotions in us (such as delight when we view Apple products), its primary goal is to solve a problem by simplifying things for users.
